# 3. Participation rights

A final dimension to the OtoCo token is its holders’ guaranteed participation rights.

Such governments rights have been embedded in many DeFi tokens, however our proposed token design seeks to improve on token holders’ “voice” by making each and every token holder a beneficiary of OtoCo’s newly formed Foundation \(see Part IV on Governance below\).

Beneficiaries of a Foundation qualify as grantees, which makes it possible to grant further tokens to long-term token holders linked to the project’s overall wellbeing, similar - albeit at the same time very different! - to how companies pay dividends.

As a result, the revenue of OtoCo has the potential to become circular, with the success of OtoCo as a business feeding into the value of the token, in turn increasing the dollar value of the Foundation’s token reserve which subject to a token holders’ vote can be dividended back to its token holders.
