# 1. A tokenized points-system

First, we add a new token economics layer to the models we studied by introducing an ”airmiles”-type loyalty scheme for users.

Such scheme would reward users in OtoCo tokens based on how much they spend in otoco.io.

This will let users convert their points to top up or pay for their purchases, without expecting them to purchase a native token to access our services, which are all priced in USD.

Such airmiles-type token layer may create very interesting price dynamics:

1. First, by linking token rewards to how much users spend in otoco.io, a direct link exists between the value of the OtoCo token and the success of otoco.io as a business.
2. Second, as with pure DeFi tokens, tokens holders can stake OtoCo tokens in liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges and earn more OtoCo tokens as reward for creating a secondary market for users’ “airmiles”.
3. This secondary market price would in turn feed back into the ratio at which OtoCo tokens can be used to spend on real, USD-priced goods and services in otoco.io.
