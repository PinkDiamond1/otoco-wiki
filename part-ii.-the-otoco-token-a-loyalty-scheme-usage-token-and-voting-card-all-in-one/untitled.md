# 2. “Proof of sale” rewards

As second key departure from the token models we studied is in how we plan to use the OtoCo token to reward outside developers in function of how well their products sell in the online, competitive marketplace otoco.io is building.

In addition to the USD-based revenue sellers generate as a result of selling their goods via the store, extra rewards in OtoCo tokens would kick in based on volume sold, the number of installs, etc.

Such sales-based token rewards would add an extra dynamic to the OtoCo token price and link its value directly to user demand for add-on components.

At the same time, otoco.io would share in the revenue generated by third-party developers, which in turn may feed into the value of otoco.io and its token.
