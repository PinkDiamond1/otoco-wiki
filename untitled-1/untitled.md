# 3. The OtoCo token sale process

We smartcontractified the bookbuilding process described above first and foremost for our own token sale process but we hope the solution may help other projects too.

Once we’ve tested it on ourselves, we will most likely offer it as a solution to our otoco.io users who want to get their token pre-sold the same way.

Before we do so, we have some more work to do, including an audit of our smart contract before we use it for our own purposes.

> **Expect an announcement in the next weeks with a firm date of the start of our pre-order period together with details of our token distribution via** [**our official “Road to OtoCo” Telegram channel**](https://t.me/TheRoadToOtoco)**.**
